# 3D One
3D One allows everyone to 3D scan objects and to manage and view their 3D models in one place.

This project was created using the following technologies:
 * Depth Camera and 3D Modeling:
    * Intel RealSense SDK
    * Open 3D
    * Open CV
 * Backend:
    * Server: Flask
    * DB: SQL Alchemy
 * Frontend
    * React.js

## Application Requirements

In order to run 3D One, you need the following:
* Intel RealSense L515 Camera plugged into a USB 3 input in a PC
* Python 3.6.8 installed

## Getting Started

First we need to install all the Python and Node.js packages used in this project:

```
cd [project dir]
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you need to go to node_modules folder and add the following code to _ file:

    watchOptions: {
      ignored: [ ignoredFiles(paths.appSrc), paths.appPublic ]
    },


Now you ready to run 3D One:
```
yarn start-api
npm start
```

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
